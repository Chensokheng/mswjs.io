**Request handler** is a function that decides whether a captured request should be mocked, and declares a mocked response in a function called "response resolver".

Here's an example of a `GET` request handler:

```js showLineNumbers
import { rest } from 'msw'

// Matches all "GET /user" requests
// and responds with the "hello world!" text body.
rest.get('/user', (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(ctx.text('hello world!'))
})
```

## Standard handlers

Mock Service Worker comes with multiple ready-to-use request handlers for working with various API types. For example, you would use the [`rest`](/docs/api/rest) handlers when mocking a REST API, and [`graphql`](/docs/api/graphql) request handlers for a GraphQL API.

## Request matching

Request handlers are responsible for requests matchingâ€”a process of deciding whether a request should be mocked. Depending on the handler's type, request matching is performed differently. For example, `rest` handlers lookup matching methods and URLs, while `graphql` parse a request query string and expects a matching operation name.
