title: mutation()
---

A request handler that captures a GraphQL mutation by the given name.

## Call signature

```ts
interface graphql {
  mutation(name: string | RegExp, resolver: ResponseResolver): RequestHandler
}
```

## Examples

### Basic mutation

```graphql
mutation Logout {
  user {
    sessionId
  }
}
```

To capture a GraphQL mutation provide its name as the first argument to the `graphql.mutation()` request handler. Using the mutation definition above, the request handler for it would look as follows:

```js focusedLines=3
import { graphql } from 'msw'

graphql.mutation('Logout', (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    ctx.data({
      user: {
        sessionId: 'abc-123',
      },
    }),
  )
})
```

### Mutation variables

```graphql focusedLines=1
mutation Login($username: String!, $password: String!) {
  login(username: $username, password: $password) {
    sessionId
  }
}
```

> Variables must be correctly defined in the GraphQL mutation definition in order to be accessible in mocks. Refer to the [GraphQL Variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables) for more information.

Use `req.variables` object to access all the variables of the captured mutation.

```js focusedLines=4
import { graphql } from 'msw'

graphql.mutation('Logout', (req, res, ctx) => {
  const { username, password } = req.variables

  return res(
    ctx.data({
      login: {
        sessionId: 'abc-123',
      },
    }),
  )
})
```

### Dynamic mutation name

When given a `RegExp` as the mutation name, all the GraphQL mutations that match that expression would be captured by this request handler.

```graphql
mutation CreateUser {
  user {
    id
  }
}

mutation DeleteUser {
  user {
    id
  }
}
```

```js focusedLines=3
import { graphql } from 'msw'

graphql.mutation(/^(.+?)User$/, (req, res, ctx) => {
  return res(
    ctx.errors([
      {
        message: 'Not authorized',
      },
    ]),
  )
})
```
