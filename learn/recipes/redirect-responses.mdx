title: Redirect responses

Mocking a redirect response is the same as constructing it in an actual server, and consists of the following steps:

- Setting the correct redirect response status code (`3xx`);
- Setting the `Location` response header specifying the redirect destination.

## External redirect

```js
rest.get('/users/:username', (req, res, ctx) => {
  const { username } = req.params

  return res(
    ctx.status(301),
    ctx.set('Location', `https://api.github.com/users/${username}`),
  )
})
```

## Relative redirect

You can redirect from one request handler to another by specifying the other handler's URL as the redirect's destination:

```js
export const handlers = [
  rest.get('/api/v1/user', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.status(308), ctx.set('Location', '/api/v2/user'))
  }),
  rest.get('/api/v2/user', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ firstName: 'John' }))
  }),
]
```

Whenever your code makes a `GET /api/v1/user` request, it will be redirected to the `/api/v2/user` URL. Since there is a request handler for that URL, the mocked response will be returned.
